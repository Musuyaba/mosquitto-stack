## About The Project
This project included in my portofolio as IoT Engineer, of course what I can use is basic sample for every stack that I use.

## Requirements

## Features
- Authentication user-password
- Encryption user password
- Add user
- Delete user
- Logging Mosquitto Broker
- Securing Connection using OpenSSL
- Example on C++, Python, and Node.js

## Usage
### Docker
- Generate SSL Certificate using this example:
```shell
# View config for debugging config
docker compose --profile ssl config
# Build to generate ssl to ./certs/generated
docker compose --profile ssl up --build
# Please note these are the last lines of ssl  
# ssl  | Certificate request self-signature ok
# ssl  | subject=C = ID, ST = EastJava, L = MusuyabaHut, O = ServerCertMusuyaba, OU = TestServerCert, CN = mosquitto-broker     
# ssl  | server.crt: OK
# ssl exited with code 0
```
